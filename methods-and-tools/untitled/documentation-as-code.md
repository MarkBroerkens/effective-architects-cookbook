## Guidelines for Writing Documentation

* Writing Readmes. [https://github.com/udacity/ud777-writing-readmes](https://github.com/udacity/ud777-writing-readmes)
* Although including inline comments in the code is a good practice, the most important piece of a project is the documentation. Similarly, a README file is the go to document in a project. Whenever someone tries to use a piece of software the first document that they look for is the README file.
  * [This web page](https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) from github itself will tell you how to write a file on github along with instructions on how to format the documents.
